<h4>
Q. Is there a way I can use these songs in my Church?
</h4>
<p>
Absolutely. In fact, the songs database that is shipped with this app is used by <a href="http://tmcsubangjaya.com"> Tamil Methodist Church Subang Jaya</a>. 
If you want to do that in your Church, you would need to install a software named OpenLP and replace it's default songs database with the one that ships with this app.
